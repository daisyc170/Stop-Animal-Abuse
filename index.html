    Malicious acts to harm an animal is the cruelest cold hearted person can be, forced to struggle for survival. No animal needs to fear for their lives, not many people talk about animal abuse and not stress enough how animals are being treated. Animal abuse comes with a long period of history. It's not only about hitting the animal, not feeding, and not giving proper care more about their feelings and how they should be treated, testing products on animals is another way showing animal abuse. This is important to me because animals are the best thing you can have. As an animal lover I hate to see animals being mistreated. I have seen many animal abuse in my block and tried to make a difference and it's been working, they should be treated as much as love the animal shows affection to us too.
